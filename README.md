A modification of the lovely Field Lights, with slightly cooler, more pastel highlighting inspired by Dracula.

I recommend using the included custom css, which is a slightly modified version of that from the fantastic cobalt2.

I use Input Mono Condensed and the Black & White City Lights Icon Theme.
